    "question": "What is QR Code Studio?",
    "answer": "QR Code Studio is a platform for creating, managing, and tracking QR codes. You can generate static QR codes, dynamic QR codes that you can update anytime, and Adaptive QRC™ codes that change their destination based on rules like time of day, date ranges, or visitor behavior.",

    "question": "Do I need an account to create QR codes?",
    "answer": "You can create unlimited static QR codes without an account. For dynamic QR codes, menus, files, vCards, portals, and Adaptive QRC™, you'll need a free account. Signing up takes less than a minute and requires no credit card.",

    "question": "What's the difference between static and dynamic QR codes?",
    "answer": "Static QR codes contain the destination URL directly in the code. Once printed, they can't be changed. Dynamic QR codes point to a short URL that you control, so you can update where they redirect anytime without reprinting. Dynamic QR codes also include scan analytics in Intel.",

    "question": "When should I use a static QR code?",
    "answer": "Use static QR codes for permanent links that won't change, like your website homepage, social media profiles, or Wi-Fi passwords. They're free, unlimited, and work offline once scanned.",

    "question": "What is Adaptive QRC™?",
    "answer": "Adaptive QRC™ is a smart QR code that changes its destination based on rules you set. For example, show a lunch menu from 11 AM to 2 PM, then switch to a dinner menu. Or redirect first-time visitors to a welcome page and returning visitors to your main site. Rules can be based on time, date ranges, day of week, or visitor behavior.",

    "question": "How do Adaptive QRC™ rules work?",
    "answer": "You create content slots (URLs or files) and set rules that determine which slot to show. Time rules can change content by hour or day. Date rules work for specific date ranges. First-return rules show different content for first-time vs returning visitors. Admin IP rules let you test or preview specific content.",
