# QR Code Studio - Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What is QR Code Studio?
QR Code Studio is a platform for creating, managing, and tracking QR codes. You can generate static QR codes, dynamic QR codes that you can update anytime, and Adaptive QRC™ codes that change their destination based on rules like time of day, date ranges, or visitor behavior.

### Do I need an account to create QR codes?
You can create unlimited static QR codes without an account. For dynamic QR codes, menus, files, vCards, portals, and Adaptive QRC™, you'll need a free account. Signing up takes less than a minute and requires no credit card.

### What's the difference between static and dynamic QR codes?
Static QR codes contain the destination URL directly in the code. Once printed, they can't be changed. Dynamic QR codes point to a short URL that you control, so you can update where they redirect anytime without reprinting. Dynamic QR codes also include scan analytics in Intel.

### How do I create my first QR code?
Click any Quick Action button (Website, Phone, Email, etc.) in Studio, choose Static or Dynamic mode, enter your content, customize the design, and generate. Your QR code will appear in your Arsenal where you can download, share, or track scans.

### Can I use QR Code Studio on mobile?
Yes. QR Code Studio works as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on mobile devices. You can install it to your home screen for a native app experience. The mobile interface is optimized for touch and smaller screens.

## Static vs Dynamic vs Adaptive QRC™

### When should I use a static QR code?
Use static QR codes for permanent links that won't change, like your website homepage, social media profiles, or Wi-Fi passwords. They're free, unlimited, and work offline once scanned.

### When should I use a dynamic QR code?
Use dynamic QR codes when you need to update the destination later, track scans, or change content without reprinting. Perfect for marketing campaigns, event pages, menus, or any link that might change.

### What is Adaptive QRC™?
Adaptive QRC™ is a smart QR code that changes its destination based on rules you set. For example, show a lunch menu from 11 AM to 2 PM, then switch to a dinner menu. Or redirect first-time visitors to a welcome page and returning visitors to your main site. Rules can be based on time, date ranges, day of week, or visitor behavior.

### How do Adaptive QRC™ rules work?
You create content slots (URLs or files) and set rules that determine which slot to show. Time rules can change content by hour or day. Date rules work for specific date ranges. First-return rules show different content for first-time vs returning visitors. Admin IP rules let you test or preview specific content.

### Can I test my Adaptive QRC™ before printing?
Yes. When you create an Adaptive QRC™, you can preview how it behaves at different times. The preview shows which content will be displayed based on your current rules and the current time.

### What happens if no Adaptive QRC™ rule matches?
If no rule matches (for example, outside your defined time windows), the Adaptive QRC™ shows your default content slot. Always set a default to ensure your QR code always works.

## Menus & Link Hubs

### Can I create a digital menu with QR Code Studio?
Yes. Use the Menu QR type to upload multiple menu pages (images or PDFs). You can add your restaurant logo, social media links, and customize the menu viewer. The menu displays as a swipeable carousel or flipbook experience when scanned.

### How many menu pages can I upload?
You can upload up to 15 menu pages. Each page can be up to 10MB (images or PDFs). The total menu size limit is 50MB. Files are automatically compressed to optimize loading speed.

### What's a Portal QR code?
Portal QR codes create a custom landing page (like Linktree) with multiple links. You can add up to 3 links, customize the design with templates, colors, fonts, and button styles, and add a title and description. All portals include our footer and watermark on the free plan.

### Can I customize my Portal design?
Yes. Portals include 3 template options (Classic, Modern, Minimal). You can customize background colors, button colors, button styles (square, rounded, minimal), font families, and font colors to match your brand.

### Do Portal QR codes work for social media?
Yes. Portal QR codes are perfect for social media bios, business cards, or anywhere you want to share multiple links. When scanned, users see a branded landing page with all your links organized and easy to tap.

## Analytics / Intel

### What is Intel?
Intel is QR Code Studio's analytics dashboard. It shows scan counts, trends over time, geographic data (where scans came from), device types, response times, and more. Intel helps you understand how your QR codes are performing.

### What analytics do I get with dynamic QR codes?
Dynamic QR codes include basic Intel: total scans, scan trends, top regions, and response times. Pro plans include full Intel with detailed breakdowns, exportable data, and advanced insights.

### Can I see where my QR codes are being scanned?
Yes. Intel shows a map with dots representing scan locations. Click any dot to see scan details for that area, including city, region, device type, and timestamp. Geographic data is based on IP address location.

### How accurate is the geographic data?
Geographic data is estimated based on IP address geolocation. It's generally accurate to the city or region level but may not be precise to exact addresses. This is standard for IP-based location services.

### Can I export my scan data?
Yes, on Pro and Command plans. You can export scan data as CSV files for analysis in spreadsheets or other tools. Exports include timestamps, locations, device types, and scan counts.

### How often is Intel data updated?
Intel data updates in real-time as scans occur. The dashboard refreshes automatically, and you can manually refresh to see the latest data. Historical data is stored and available for trend analysis.

### Are there watermarks on free QR codes?
Yes. Dynamic QR codes, menus, files, vCards, and portals created on the free plan include a watermark. Static QR codes and the QR code image itself don't have watermarks. Upgrade to Pro to remove all watermarks.

## Security & Reliability

### Are my QR codes secure?
Yes. All QR codes are generated securely, and your account data is protected. Dynamic QR codes use short URLs that are unique and difficult to guess. We use industry-standard security practices for authentication and data storage.

### Can someone else access or modify my QR codes?
No. Only you can access and modify your QR codes through your account. QR codes are tied to your user account and protected by authentication. Always keep your login credentials secure.

### What happens if QR Code Studio goes down?
QR codes themselves are stored in the code image, so static QR codes work even if our servers are down. Dynamic QR codes require our servers to redirect, but we maintain high uptime and redundancy to ensure reliability.

### How long do my QR codes stay active?
Static QR codes work forever. Dynamic QR codes stay active as long as your account is active. Adaptive QRC™ codes on the free plan expire after 30 days; Pro Adaptive QRC™ codes never expire.

### Can I delete my QR codes?
Yes. You can delete any QR code from your Arsenal at any time. When you delete a QR code, associated files (menu images, PDFs, etc.) are also removed from storage. Deleted QR codes cannot be recovered.

## Printing & Best Practices

### What size should I print my QR code?
Print QR codes at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) square for reliable scanning. Larger is better, especially for distance scanning. For posters or signage, 3-4 inches works well. Test scan your printed QR code before mass printing.

### What file formats can I download?
You can download QR codes as PNG (for web and printing), SVG (vector, scalable), JPEG, or PDF. PNG is recommended for most use cases. SVG is best if you need to scale the QR code to different sizes.

### Can I add my logo to QR codes?
Yes. Pro plans include logo upload. You can add your logo to the center of the QR code, adjust its size, and customize colors. Logos are embedded in the QR code image and don't affect scanability when sized appropriately.

### What's the best error correction level?
Medium (M) is recommended for most QR codes. It balances data capacity with error tolerance. Use High (H) if your QR code will be printed small or in challenging conditions. Use Low (L) only if you need maximum data capacity and have perfect printing conditions.

### Can I customize QR code colors?
Yes. You can customize foreground and background colors. Ensure high contrast between colors for reliable scanning. Dark QR codes on light backgrounds (or vice versa) work best. Avoid similar colors or low contrast combinations.

### What's the best practice for QR code placement?
Place QR codes where they're easily accessible and scannable. Ensure good lighting, avoid reflective surfaces, and leave white space around the code. For menus, place QR codes on tables, countertops, or entry points. For marketing materials, place them prominently but not intrusively.

### Can I use QR codes for lead generation?
Yes. Dynamic QR codes are perfect for lead generation. Create a QR code that links to a landing page, form, or contact page. Use Intel to track how many people scan and where they're coming from. This helps measure campaign effectiveness.

### Are QR codes good for digital signage?
Yes. QR codes work great for digital signage. Use dynamic QR codes so you can update destinations without changing the display. Adaptive QRC™ is especially powerful for digital signage, allowing different content based on time of day or other rules.
