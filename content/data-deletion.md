## What May Be Retained

### Aggregated Analytics

## How to Request Deletion

### Option 1: Self-Service (If Available)
TODO: Confirm if self-service account deletion is implemented in the app. If yes, describe the process here.

### Option 2: Email Request
Send an email to **support@luminarapps.com** with:
- Subject line: "Account Deletion Request"
- Your account email address
- Confirmation that you want to permanently delete your account and all data
- Any specific concerns or questions

## Deletion Process Timeline

1. **Request received:** We acknowledge your request within 24-48 hours
2. **Verification:** We may verify your identity to protect your account
3. **Deletion:** Account and data deletion begins within 48-72 hours
4. **Confirmation:** You receive confirmation when deletion is complete

**Total timeline:** Typically 3-5 business days from request to completion.

## Important Considerations

### Before Deleting Your Account

1. **Export your data:** If you want to keep any QR codes or analytics, export or download them before deletion
2. **Update printed materials:** If you have printed QR codes, they will stop working after deletion. Consider updating or removing them
3. **Cancel subscriptions:** If you have an active Pro or Command subscription, cancel it separately to avoid charges
4. **Backup files:** Download any uploaded files (menus, PDFs) you want to keep

### After Deletion

- **Account cannot be recovered:** Deleted accounts cannot be restored
- **QR codes stop working:** All your QR codes will immediately stop redirecting
- **Files are removed:** All uploaded files are permanently deleted
- **Analytics are lost:** All scan data and analytics are permanently deleted

### Partial Deletion

If you only want to delete specific QR codes or files (not your entire account):
- You can delete individual QR codes from your Arsenal
- Deleting a QR code also deletes associated files and scan data for that QR code
- This does not delete your account

## Verification Process

To protect your account, we may require verification before processing deletion:
- Email confirmation from your registered email address
- Additional identity verification for sensitive accounts (if applicable)

## Questions About Deletion

If you have questions about the deletion process or what data will be deleted, contact us at **support@luminarapps.com** before submitting a deletion request.

## Data Deletion for EU/UK Users

- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")

These rights are in addition to the deletion process described above. Contact support@luminarapps.com to exercise these rights.
